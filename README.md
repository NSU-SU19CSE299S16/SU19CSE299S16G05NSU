**Problem I am trying to solve:**
 People  , mainly fresh graduates finds it hard to find a job and look out for one . And different companies can not find employees according  to their vacancies and demand . I will endeavor to make a common spot to meet job seekers  and job providers.


**How my product will solve the problem:**

Jobs will be pushed to the  newsfeed of job seeker according to their qualifications and they can directly apply from our site. Only thoese can apply whoese requirments will matched with providers conditions.

**Monetization:**
Companies have to give an amount to post about their post and give profit In a certain amount after getting candidate for their vacancies. We also have the facilities to make payment using Bkash , Ucash and other mobile banking services .we will send email notification to to every eligible candidate if a job circular is posted and it matches with their requirement and qualification .
